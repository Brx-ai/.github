## Welcome to BRX.ai

Our mission
Empower the next generation of builders.
Amplify, not replace.

Our Origin
We are enabling developers to utilize generative AI to its full potential BRX was established in 2023. After years of tinkering with the earlier GPT models, we were struggling to get underperforming generative AI models to give reliable and accurate outputs for more complex interactions. After many breakthroughs, we decided to bring our toolkit to market to share what we’ve learned, and amplify the way other people work too. We have partnered with Google and Microsoft’s Startup Programs to begin unleashing the first AI agnostic LLM infrastructure for individuals and enterprises to build with. We can’t wait to see what you create.
